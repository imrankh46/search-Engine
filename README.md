# Text Improvement Engine

## Project Overview

The Text Improvement Engine is a tool that analyzes a given text and suggests improvements based on the similarity to a list of "standardized" phrases. These standardized phrases represent the ideal way certain concepts should be articulated, and the tool recommends changes to align the input text closer to these standards.
